# Paris Map Route Finder

This is a JavaFX project that analyses a map of Paris to find the most efficient routes between landmarks. This project was developed as part of CA2 for the Data Structures and Algorithms module at SETU.

## Instructions
* Select a start and end destinations using the drop down menus
* Choose your preferred pathfinding method below
* Click the Go button to display the route on the map

## Details
* This program used graphs to create a map of landmarks (Landmarks are nodes, Roads are edges)
* Agorithms such as Dijkstra's and BFS then use the graphs to find routes between landmarks
* Landmarks and roads are stored in XML files which are then used by the program
